			<div class="aboutBox">
				<p class="paddingParagraph">Seizure-oke is a bold statement in the world of user-centric design where the first principle is that the product shouldn't harm the user. Seizure-oke strongly believes that users should have the freedom to get visual impairments and damaged retinas, should they choose to do so.

					<span class="question">1. Why Seizure-oke?</span>
					It's Friday night. You and your friends are off to enjoy an amazing night out and you start off at a Karaoke-TV. You put your favorite jam on and start singing, only to find yourself severely disappointed by the lack of creative visuals. It's almost like, they don't even care what is displayed on screen while you sing. This ruins your whole night, leading you to eventually set on a path of world domination.
					<br>
					Has this ever happened to you?
					<br>
					Welcome to a new generation of Karaoke background that is highly customized to you and you alone. We guarantee that by the time that you have finished singing, the background displayed is unique in the whole world, likely for all eternity of time. You will be able to get a real time feedback from the screen, that reacts dynamically to the pitches in your voice.


					<span class="question">2. Did you have to really hurt my eyes in the process?</span>
					Maybe(probably) not. I could have definitely at leat changed the background to be a bit less bright. But in this cut-throat, competitive world, what is anything if it doesn't scream out idiosyncrasy? 
					Plus, user-testing revealed that some users are actually masochistic enough to enjoy such pain, which is a target group that we could not really forgo. Finally, yes, maybe you hurt your eyes today, but you have imparted a valuable lesson from the experience: when someone asks you three times if you're sure, maybe you should reconsider.<br>

					<span class="question">3. Why do you only show a part of the lyrics?</span>
					This was in part a bad API choice on my behalf. This app is <a href=https://developer.musixmatch.com/>powered by Musixmatch</a> and they only allow one third of the lyrcis to be displayed. 

					<span class="question">4. Why are you using it then? Aren't there others?</span>
					I know, I will switch and use other ones before this project is completed.

					<span class="question">5. Um, a real question here? Where is the background music if this is a Karaoke?</span>
					It is there. It's just that like Santa Claus, it only appears to you if you've been a good person. If you need help with hearing the sounds, please refer to <a href= "ss8355.nyuad.im/sevenClicks">seven clicks to God</a> to find your salvation. <br>

					 But in all seriousness, there weren't many APIs that would be happy to provide a web platform their full music. I am considering getting around this issue with either adding mp3 files to the backend database once that gets going, or just using the spotify api's 30 second preview and leaving the users wanting more.

					<span class="question">6. Lyrics syncing works weirdly for me?</span>
					
					Speed adjustment was an affordances built in to allow users to change the speed of the lyric updates. This was in part to provide user with full control of the pace in which they sing. To ensure lyric doesn't whip by while user is changing the lyric speed, the lyrics don't load until the speed has been finally determined by the user. I think that we could improve the usability of this affordance by giving user a reference to exactly what these numbers mean in terms of speed.

					<span class="sectionTitle">Difficulties Faced</span>

					<span class="question">1. Syncing lyrics</span>

					Lyric syncing wasn't a provided feature of the API unless it was used for an IOS app. Creating a whole new program to help the process of auto-matching lyrics and song seemed to be like something that's beyond the scope of this simple project. As this is something that can't just be done manually unless there is a fixed set of songs which will be queried, I am considering looking at datapoints where I can map points in the songs to lyrics when I have database. Currently, I address this issue by allowing users to go fast or slow on their lyrics.

					<span class="question">2. Switching between pages</span>
					This was the first time I was doing this, and this was a bit confusing at first with the intervals set to control the lyrics' speed. I think a more oop approach could have made my life easier. Ensuring the robustness of the system through setting conditions was also a hassle especially given the asynchronous nature of the API.
