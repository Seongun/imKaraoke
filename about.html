		<h1 class = "title">About seizure-oke</h1>

			<div class="aboutBox">
				<p>Seizure-oke is a bold statement in the world of user-centric designs where the first principle is that the product shouldn't harm the user. Seizure-oke strongly believes that users should have the freedom to get visual impairments and damaged retinas, should they choose to do so.

					<span class="question">1. Why?</span>
					It's Friday night. Your friends are off to enjoy an amazing night out and you start off at a Karaoke-TV. You put your favorite jam on and start singing, only to find yourself severely disappointed by the lack of creative visuals. It's almost like, they don't even care what is displayed on screen while you sing. This ruins your whole night, leading you to eventually set on a path of world domination.
					<br>
					Has this ever happened to you?
					<br>
					Welcome to a new generation of Karaoke background that is highly customized to you and you alone. We guarantee that by the time that you have finished singing, the background displayed is unique in the whole world, likely for all eternity of time. You will be able to get a real time feedback from the screen, that reacts dynamically to the pitches in your voice. 


					<span class="question">2. Did you have to really hurt my eyes in the process?</span>
					Maybe(probably) not. I could have definitely at leat changed the background to be a bit less bright. But in this cut-throat, competitive world, what is anything if it doesn't scream out its identity? Also, yes, maybe you hurt your eyes today, but you have imparted a valuable lesson: when someone asks you three times if you're sure, maybe you should reconsider<br>

					<span class="question">3. Why do you only show a part of the lyrics?</span>
					This was in part a bad API choice on my behalf. This app is "powered by Musixmatch" and they only allow one third of the lyrcis to be displayed. "(insert Musixmatch api logo here)"

					<span class="question">4. Why are you using it then? Aren't there others?</span>
					I know, I will switch and use other ones before this project is completed.

					<span class="question">5. Um, a real question here? Where is the background music if this is a Karaoke?</span>
					It's like Santa, and you can hear it if you've been a good person. But in all seriousness, there weren't many APIs that would be happy to provide a web platform their full music. I am considering getting around this issue with either adding mp3 files to the backend db once that gets going, or just using the spotify api's 30 second preview and leaving the users wanting more.

					<span class="question">6. Lyrics syncing works weird for me?</span>
					I thought it was going to work better if the user could change their own pace in which they sing, but the lyrics don't load until the speed has been finally determined by the user. I think that we could improve this by giving user a reference to exactly what these numbers mean in terms of speed.

					<hr>
					<span class="question">1. Getting Music</span>
					

					<span class="question">2. Lyrics API</span>

					<span class="question">3. Syncing lyrics</span>

					<span class="question">3. Switching between pages</span>
					This was the first time I was doing this, and this was a bit confusing at first with the intervals set to control the lyrics' speed. I think a more oop approach could have made my life easier.

					<span class="sectionTitle">Ideas for the Future</span>
					<hr>

					<span class="question">1. Get Different Goals</span>
					If you decide to stray from the path of the Lord and perhaps choose a differnt goal to this game, I will let you do it in the future. God forbid, you might even play this game with Hitler as the goal.

					<span class="question">2. Time Attack</span>
					Will add time features to this game later so that friends can play against each other. This means that I will have to change the code so that next 8 choices can render before the image of the current choice itself is shown, so that appropriate timing can be shown.
